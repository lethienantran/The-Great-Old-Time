<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>Rust is quite new to me. I am in a learning process in programming in Rust. First of all, I have tried a lot of ways and read a lot of documents to put struct in different files, but somehow I can't do it (Maybe I haven't research about it much). Secondly, I tried to do in an object-oriented way, so that the code is more organized and meaningful, however, it is a challenge for me to do in Rust. Last but not least, finish this game in 2 hours is also really a challenge to me. Haha! However, the game turns out working and I really like it. It helps me understand more about Rust and the concept of low level language.</p>
